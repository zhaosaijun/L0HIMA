# Description of L0HIMA
This R package implements the L0-regularized high-dimensional mediation analysis method. Specifically0, L0HIMA allows for the test and estimation of high-dimensional mediation effects, which can accommodate various outcome data types in the context of linear, logistic, Poisson, Cox proportional hazards, and accelerated failure time models.
